      <h3>box-shadow</h3>
      <p>box-shadow is similar to <a href="typography.html#shadow">text-shadow</a> except it sets shadow for the
      entire box.  It also accepts a couple of optional extra parameters.  The
      first is spread which controls the size of the shadow.  Negative values are
      allowed.  Inset can be placed (optionally) after color and changes the
      shadow from an outer shadow to an inner shadow.</p>
      <pre>
        box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 8px rgba(255,0,0, .5), inset;
        box-shadow: x y blur* spread* color**, inset*;</pre>
      <p>Note that in the above '*' denotes an optional parameter.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 3px 5px 0px 1px rgba(0,0,255,1);</pre>
      <p class="ex box-shadow1">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>

      <p>This is an inset shadow with a blur.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 3px 5px 3px 1px rgba(0,200,150,1) inset;</pre>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-inset">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>

      <p>This one has a higher value for spread.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 3px 5px 3px 8px rgba(0,200,150,1) inset;</pre>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-inset-spread">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>

      <p>This one looks a bit better.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 5px rgba(50,0,0,.5);</pre>
      <br>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-pretty">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>box-shadows can also be stacked by separating with commas</h3>
      <pre>  box-shadow:  10px 10px 15px 15px rgba(250,0,0,.5),
                         -10px 10px 15px 15px rgba(0,250,0,.5),
                          10px -10px 15px 15px rgba(0,0,250,.5);
      </pre>
      <br>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-crazy">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
