    <section class="container">
      <h3>Ex 1: Our usual 3 boxes</h3>
      We've assigned them a 50% width to make this easier.
      They are set as <pre class='block'>display: block;</pre>
      <section class="above">Above</section>
      <section class="box1">First Section</section>
      <section class="box2">Second Section</section>

    <section class="container">
      <h3>Ex 2: setting the second box to have an offset from the top-right</h3>
      <pre>
        .offset-tr {
          position: absolute;
          right: 20px;
          top: 20px;
        }
      </pre>
      As we see, it ends up at the top of the page.  It lacks a parent to derive
      it's relative positioning from.  Therefore it's positioned based on the
      body.
      <section class="above">Above</section>
      <section class="box1">First Section</section>
      <section class="box2 offset-tr">Second Section (See exhibit 2)</section>
      <section class="box3">Third Section</section>
      <section class="below">Below</section>
    </section>



    <section class="container">
      <h3>Ex 3: box 2 with offset and parent set to relative</h3>
      <pre>
        .offset-tr {
          position: absolute;
          right: 20px;
          top: 20px;
        }
        .relative {
          position: relative;
        }
      </pre>
      In this case we've also wrapped the whole group in a div with .relative set.
      The position of the 'absolute'ly positioned element is derived from the parent
      'relative'ly positioned element.
      <div class="relative">
        <section class="above">Above</section>
        <section class="box1">First Section</section>
        <section class="box2 offset-tr">Second Section</section>
        <section class="box3">Third Section</section>
        <section class="below">Below</section>
      </div>
    </section>



    <section class="container">
      <h3>Ex 4: The results of setting all 3 boxes to absolute positioning.</h3>
      Box 2 still has an offset, which is based on the 'div' surrounding these.
      As can (almost) be seen, the first and third boxes are stacked on the 'below'
      box.  This shows how their size is not included in the page and instead they
      float where they would have been otherwise.
      <div class="relative">
        <section class="above">Above</section>
        <section class="box1 absolute">First Section</section>
        <section class="box2 offset-tr">Second Section</section>
        <section class="box3 absolute">Third Section, position: 'absolute'</section>
        <section class="below">Below</section>
      </div>
