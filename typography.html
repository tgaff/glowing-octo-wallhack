      <p class="ex">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

      <h3>Now we show color, font-size and font-style (italic)</h3>

      <h3>font-weight accepts:</h3>
      <p>"normal", "bold", "bolder", "lighter", and "inherit".  It can also accept
      numeric values (which should be defined in the font).</p>

      <h3>line-height controls the distance between lines of text</h3>
      <p>we can use values like "15px", "150%", "1.5"</p>
      <p class="ex line-height">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life

      </p>
      <p>Also, it should be noted that one way to vertically center text is to
        specify identical values for the line-height and height properties.

      <h3>We can combine these as well:</h3>
      <pre>
        color: #E0E,

        font-style: italic;
        font-variant: small-caps;

      <h2>text properties</h2>
      <p>Next we'll take a look at text properties.  These allow us to align,
      decorate, indent, transform and control the spacing of text.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h3>text-align, text-decoration and text-indent</h3>
      <p>text-align can be set to left, right, center, justify and inherit</p>
      <p>text-decoration can be set to none, underline, overline, line-through
        and inherit.</p>
      <p>text-indent only indents the first line of text in an element.  All
        common length values are supported.  Here we use a 40px indent.</p>
      <pre>  text-align: right;
        text-decoration: underline;
        text-indent: 40px;</pre>
      <p class="ex align-decoration-indent">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life

    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h3>text-shadow</h3>
      <p>text-shadow takes parameters for:
        <ul>
          <li>horizontal-offset</li>
          <li>vertical-offset</li>
          <li>blur-radius</li>
          <li>color and opacity</li>
        </ul>
        By setting negative values for the offsets the shadow can be moved
        upwards and to the left.
      </p>
      <pre>text-shadow: 4px 8px 2px rgba(255,0,0, .5);</pre>
      <p class="ex shadow">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="container">
      <h3>more text shadows</h3>
      <p>By setting negative values for the offsets the shadow can be moved
        upwards and to the left.  We can also have multiple text-shadows by
        seperating them with commas.
      </p>
      <pre>  text-shadow: 4px 8px 2px rgba(255,0,0, .5), -10px -6px 5px rgba(0,0,255, .3);
</pre>
      <p class="ex double-shadow">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.

      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section class="container">
      <h3>box-shadow</h3>
      <p>box-shadow is similar to text-shadow except it sets shadow for the
      entire box.  It also accepts a couple of optional extra parameters.  The
      first is spread which controls the size of the shadow.  Negative values are
      allowed.  Inset can be placed (optionally) after color and changes the
      shadow from an outer shadow to an inner shadow.</p>
      <pre>
        box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 8px rgba(255,0,0, .5), inset;
        box-shadow: x y blur* spread* color**, inset*;</pre>
      <p>Note that in the above '*' denotes an optional parameter.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 3px 5px 0px 1px rgba(0,0,255,1);</pre>
      <p class="ex box-shadow1">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>

      <p>This is an inset shadow with a blur.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 3px 5px 3px 1px rgba(0,200,150,1) inset;</pre>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-inset">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>

      <p>This one has a higher value for spread.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 3px 5px 3px 8px rgba(0,200,150,1) inset;</pre>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-inset-spread">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>

      <p>This one looks a bit better.</p>
      <pre>box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px 5px rgba(50,0,0,.5);</pre>
      <br>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-pretty">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>box-shadows can also be stacked by separating with commas</h3>
      <pre>  box-shadow:  10px 10px 15px 15px rgba(250,0,0,.5),
                         -10px 10px 15px 15px rgba(0,250,0,.5),
                          10px -10px 15px 15px rgba(0,0,250,.5);
      </pre>
      <br>
      <p class="ex box-shadow-crazy">'I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.
      Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life
      before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.
